1. < strong > and < em >
    - < strong > is used to denote strong importance and should be used sparingly.
    - < em > is used to denote emphasis and should also be used sparingly.
    - Best practice is to use these tags for their intended purposes, instead of for visual purposes like bold or italic text.

2. `< b >` and `< i >`
    - `< b >` is used to denote text that should be stylistically offset from the normal text, often bold.
    - `< i >` is used to denote text that should be stylistically offset from the normal text, often italic.
    - Best practice is to use `<strong>` and `<em>` instead of `<b>` and `<i>` for their intended purposes.

3. `< u >` and `< s >`
    - `< u >` is used to underline text.
    - `< s >` is used to strike through text.

4. `< sup >` and `< sub>`
    - `< sup>` is used to denote superscript text, such as in mathematical equations.
    - `< sub>` is used to denote subscript text, such as in chemical formulas.
    - Best practice is to use these tags for their intended purposes and to avoid using them for visual purposes like shifting text up or down.
